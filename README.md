# App Academy Projects
----------------------
This was started with [Varun](https://github.com/varunprabhakar14) but completed solo. See my related blog post [here](http://blog.cssherry.com/post/105412733689/w2d2-class-inheritance-and-the-tale-of-iteration) and [here](http://blog.cssherry.com/post/105499834509/w2d3-chess-completed).

### W2D2 and W2D3
* Class inheritance
* Exceptions, error handling
* Decomposition into objects
* Inheritance, Polymorphism and DRY
* Information hiding/encapsulation

# How to Run These Files
These files require Ruby to run. The best tutorial I've found is this: [Ruby Installation Tutorial](http://installrails.com/steps)

Once Ruby is installed, bundle install, download the files, go into terminal, and either run the game interface

$ ruby chess.rb *recommended

or run them through irb

$ irb
$ load 'chess.rb'
